# Scripts

This folder contains various scripts that I've built.

### Clear-PublicSession.ps1
This Powershell script is for folks playing GTA5 Online (PC). This affectively creates a solo public lobby for the player. Be aware that the script takes about 10 seconds to run. Instructions for setting up and running the script are in the script header.

### Get-DiskUtilization.ps1
This Powershell script allows you to scan your local drives to see where your disk space has gone. Great minimal tool for SysAdmins to recover disk space.

### health record migration for moveup.sql
This SQL script leverages MySQL functions to update a database.

### kindergarten field update.sql
This SQL sample shows the use of case statements, CONCAT, SUBSTR, and LOCATE within an UPDATE statement.

### new database with contact migration.sql
This SQL script leverages MySQL functions to perform a database migration.

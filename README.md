# Scripts

This repository contains various scripts that I've built. They are free for public use.

### Clear-PublicSession.ps1
This script is for folks playing GTA5 Online (PC). This affectively creates a solo public lobby for the player. Be aware that the script takes about 10 seconds to run. Instructions for setting up and running the script are in the script header.
